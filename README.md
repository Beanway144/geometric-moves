# Geometric Moves
This is a repository of scripts that search through geometric triangulations of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

- `geometricmoves.py`  contains functions for applying local (2-3 or 3-2) moves to a geometric triangulation, updating the geometric shapes and the triangulation.
- `geometricsearch.py` contains various scripts for searching through the geometric subgraph of the Pachner graph, using geometric 2-3 and 3-2 moves.
- `verifyisolated.py` quickly verifies if an input sig is geometrically isolated. Not dependent on other files here.
- `testmoves.py` contains functions to test geometric moves.
