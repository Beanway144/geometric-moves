This directory contains files for the first 152 manifolds in the SnapPy Orientable Cusped Census. The search begins in the census triangulation and performs BFS outwards. The search doesn't go over 7 tetrahedra. If an inessential triangulation is found, it is recorded but the search won't continue down that path.

Oriented:
-2 = innessential
-1 = negatively oriented
0 = pseudogeometric (has flat tets)
1 = geometric
